# Homework Four
This reposity contains three different versions of the same project that were meant to explore different ways of building the application. The [withbootstrap](https://github.com/micahluedtke/engineering_computation_data_science/tree/master/HomeworkFour/withbootstrap) folder contains the final version of the project and a youtube video exporing the application can be found [here](https://youtu.be/3Pa5rkKTjDw). Apologies for the low quality of the video, the export was slow. I will expore a higher quality video when I can commit the processing power to it and reupload. 

*Note:* This project is build on a synthetic book database that is not yet part of this code base. Please see the video linked above to view the app and its functionality. This code could be att

## withboostrap
This repository brings together all the components that I explored in earlier versions of the application --flask, Blueprints, and Bootstrap-- and attempts to have concise, well organized, and logical code. The application is built to interact with the books, author, and publisher tables. It has full CRUD functionality for all three tables (books, authors, and publishers).

## basicbuild
This was the initial attemp at building the application. The app.py file quickly became overloaded with code and the templates were combersome to use. It isn't very pretty but works for most CRUD functions, but only with the books table.

## withblueprint
This was a second build of the application to familiarize myself with [Blueprints](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/views/), which were crucial in cleaning up and organizing my code. It has full CRUD functionality, but primarily with the books table.
